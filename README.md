# Nurse Matching CLI Tool

This project is a command-line tool that matches nurses to patients based on availability, skills, and other constraints. It uses optimization strategies, including OR-Tools solvers.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

## Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t nurse-matching-app .
```

## Run the CLI Tool

To start the CLI inside the container:

```bash
docker run -it nurse-matching-app
```

This runs the application using `python -m cli.cli` as the entry point.

## Project Structure

- `cli/cli.py`: Main CLI entry point
- `strategies/`: Contains different patient matching strategies
- `solvers/`: Optimization logic (e.g., OR-Tools based solvers)
- `assignments.json`: Output file generated by the CLI (if used)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies


```bash
docker build -t nurse-matching-app .
```

## To change files for nurses or patients
-add file to /data
-In cli/cli on lines 25-26 change path to the desired path for your new nurses or patients
